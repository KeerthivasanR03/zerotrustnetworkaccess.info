paragraphs: 
  - text: "Requires different all areas of the network be connected, and routable for any kind of traffic and uses host-based firewalls instead of perimeter devices to enforce ACLs."
  - text: "Vendor manages firewalls on the host OS to control access"

strengths:
  - title: "No appliances to deploy"
    description: ""
  - title: "Universal protocol support"
    description: ""
  - title: "North-south (client-to-server) traffic"
    description: "Host-based firewalls determine access so are agnostic to traffic type provided the endpoints are able to route packets to each another"

weaknesses:
  - title: "Primarily agent-based deployment"
