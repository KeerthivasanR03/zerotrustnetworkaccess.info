strengths:
  - title: "North-South traffic"
    description: "Traffic crossing the network perimeter, originating from outside the network, addressed to private systems within the network. Often resembles client-to-server connectivity"

weaknesses:
  - title: "Business network depends on relay uptime"
    description: ""
  - title: "High availability requires multiple appliances"

  - title: "East-West traffic"
    description: "Internal network traffic, originating inside the network perimeter and addressed to other private systems within the network. Often resembles server-to-server, machine-to-machine, inter-region connectivity or traffic inside a service mesh or service cluster. Moving East-West traffic through network relays can be inefficient"

tradeoffs:
  - title: "Trust broker becomes the new target"
    description: "In order for endpoints to connect to it, the trust broker must be publicly accessible"
