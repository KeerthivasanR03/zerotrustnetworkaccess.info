paragraphs: 
  - text: "Vendor's product controls access to end systems. End-user credentials are transparently swapped for ephemeral credentials which grant temporary access. Some vendors may offer session recording and playback. Assumes client has network access to target system."
  - text: "Vendor assumes client has a network pathway available to reach target server"

strengths:
  - title: "Protocol aware"
    description: "Access to application traffic"
  - title: "Session recording and playback"
    description: "Products are often able to record and playback sessions for some protocols such as SSH, RDP and database traffic"
  - title: "Credentials never exposed to end-user"
    description: "End-users are given temporary credentials for access, safeguarding primary credentials for the system"

weaknesses:
  - title: "Proxy servers are public on the Internet"
    description: "Some vendors may offer proxy servers to provide access to services separated from the client via the WAN. If available, proxy servers need to be publicly available so end-users may connect in order to authenticate"
  - title: "East-west (server-to-server) traffic"
    description: "Sessions lean heavily on user identity which may not be available for east-west traffic patterns"
  - title: "Limited protocol support"
    description: "Proxy based, so offers limited protocol support and so may not be able to replace VPN"

tradeoffs:
  - title: "Trust broker becomes the new target"
    description: "In order for endpoints to connect, the trust broker must be accessible on the network"
  - title: "Assumes network reachability"
    description: "PAM solutions provide temporary credentials for service access, but often assumes a private network is already in place to provide network connectivity to target services either via the local network or WAN"
