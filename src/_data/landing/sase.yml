title: "Gartner hails a SASE future. Forrester calls it Zero-Trust Edge."
description: "Secure Service Access Edge (SASE) or Zero-Trust Edge (ZTE) is the concept of combining network security functions with WAN capabilities in such a way so as to align with Zero Trust principles. Implementations are primarily delivered as a Service and policy decisions are based on the identity of connecting entities, real time context and security posture. While SASE points to a larger amalgamation of existing tooling, Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) is a central component of the architecture."
