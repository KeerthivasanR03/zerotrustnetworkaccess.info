label: "The Seven Tenets of Zero Trust"
paragraphs:
  - text: The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines Zero Trust and a Zero Trust Architecture in terms of seven basic tenets. Though these tenets are the ideal goal, not all tenets need be fully implemented in their purest form for a given strategy. The British National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has also published a set of Zero Trust architecture design principles in which they define eight principles to help organizations implement a zero trust network architecture.
