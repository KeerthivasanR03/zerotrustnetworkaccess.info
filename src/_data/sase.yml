      Secure Service Access Edge (SASE) or Zero-Trust Edge (ZTE) combines network security functions with WAN capabilities to support the dynamic secure access needs of organizations. These capabilities are delivered primarily as a Service and based upon the identity of the entity, real time context and security / compliance policies. Central to the Zero Trust Edge (ZTE) model is Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) to authenticate and authorize users.
