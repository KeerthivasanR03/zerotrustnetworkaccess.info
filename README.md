# How to contribute

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Test your changes to make sure they work as expected.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
